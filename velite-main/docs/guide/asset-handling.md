## Uploading Assets

You can upload assets to your OSS, CDN, or other storage services.

e.g. Upload images on complete hook:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'velite'

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    base: 'https://oss.your.com/static/'
  },
  complete: async () => {
    // TODO: upload images
    // static => https://oss.your.com/static/
  }
})
```

Currently, we don't provide any built-in uploading plugins, we will provide them in the future.
